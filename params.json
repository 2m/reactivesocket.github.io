{"name":"ReactiveSocket","tagline":"Persistent, duplex, binary, stream-oriented client/server protocol and libraries.","body":"ReactiveSocket is network protocol with client and server that uses [Reactive Streams](http://reactive-stream.org) (and optimistically [Reactive Stream IO](http://reactive-stream.io) as it gets defined).\r\n\r\nIt enables the following interaction models via async message passing over a single network connection:\r\n\r\n- request/response (stream of 1)\r\n- request/stream (finite stream of many)\r\n- fire-and-forget (no response)\r\n- event subscription (infinite stream of many)\r\n\r\nThe [core project for Java](https://github.com/ReactiveSocket/reactivesocket-java) implements the protocol and exposes Reactive Stream APIs. Typically most use will come via another library that uses the core. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n- ReactiveSocket over WebSockets using Netty [reactivesocket-websockets-netty](https://github.com/ReactiveSocket/reactivesocket-websockets-netty)\r\n- ReactiveSocket over TCP using Netty [reactivesocket-tcp-netty](https://github.com/ReactiveSocket/reactivesocket-tcp-netty)\r\n- ReactiveSocket over Aeron using Aeron Java [reactivesocket-aeron-java](https://github.com/ReactiveSocket/reactivesocket-aeron-java)\r\n- ReactiveSocket over HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 using Netty [reactivesocket-http-netty](https://github.com/ReactiveSocket/reactivesocket-http-netty)\r\n\r\nReactiveSocket is for communicating across network boundaries thus it is intended to be polyglot. Currently only Javascript is being pursued:\r\n\r\n- ReactiveSocket over WebSockets using Javascript (for Node.js and browsers) [reactivesocket-websockets-javascript](https://github.com/ReactiveSocket/reactivesocket-websockets-javascript)\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute an implementation in another language or for different libraries, platforms or frameworks of your choice, please contact us to explore creating a new repo.
